							<h3 class="topic">Tesla to release self-driving Beta capable of ‘zero intervention’<h3>
							<img src="../images/smart.jpg">
							<p class="realContent">
								Tesla CEO Elon Musk stated earlier today that the latest build of FSD software would be released “in a few weeks.”<br>

								Musk’s idea of a completely self-driving vehicle has been evident for several years. Obtaining full autonomy is anything but an easy task, and Musk recognizes that other companies have done an efficient job creating driver assistance features to increase safety.<br>

								While ARK Invest’s Tasha Keeney described the process and development of self-driving vehicles in a series of tweets on Thursday, Musk stated that Waymo, another company with its sights set on fully-autonomous navigation, is doing an “impressive” job with developing zero-intervention driving capabilities.<br>

								The Tesla CEO then revealed that the company would release “the latest build” in a few weeks, which is capable of zero-intervention drives. This means that those operating the company’s vehicles with the Full Self-Driving suite will not be required to input any commands to their car.<br>

								The introduction of this capability hints toward the possible rollout of Tesla’s Robotaxi fleet, which will be the company’s in-house ride-hailing service. Before Tesla can allow drivers to use the Robotaxi fleet to take people from location to location, it must refine and improve its Autopilot and Full-Self Driving Suite, which the company has done through a series of Software Updates to improve functionality.<br>

								The announcement also coincides with Elon Musk’s belief that Tesla would be able to make use of the Robotaxi fleet in 2021. During the Q1 Earnings Call in 2020, Musk described his idea for the Robotaxi’s imminent rollout in 2021. “Not in all markets, but some,” he said.<br>

								Tesla’s ride-sharing service will eventually be comprised of previously leased Tesla vehicles, along with a fleet of currently-owned cars. Owners of Tesla vehicles will be able to make up to $30,000 a year by placing the cars into the Tesla network, giving people on-demand access to transportation through the “Car Access” feature on the Tesla Smartphone app.<br>

								The rollout of a zero-intervention self-driving infrastructure will revolutionize the way people drive cars. One thing that will undoubtedly improve is vehicle safety, as Tesla cars that operate on Autopilot and Full Self-Driving are 9.5 times less likely to be involved in an accident, the company’s most recent safety report said.<br>

							<h3 class="topic">Elon Musk promises $25,000 Tesla and says Model S 'Plaid' is coming soon</h3>
							<p class="realContent">
								<b>(CNN Business)</b>Elon Musk ended Tesla's big battery event Tuesday evening with some big promises about the pricing of Tesla's future cars and the announcement of a new ultra-fast version of today's Model S.<br>
								<i>
								After reviewing improvements in Tesla's own battery designs and manufacturing advancements that could result in huge reductions in battery costs, Musk promised a $25,000 Tesla electric car that would be available in about three years.</i>
								That would be much cheaper than any car Tesla has made so far. Musk has a history of sometimes under-delivering on promises, or even not delivering at all. Years ago, Tesla promised a $35,000 electric car, the Tesla Model 3, but even then the Model 3 was only available at that price for a short time.<br>
								Musk also promised on Tuesday that the $25,000 car would be capable of driving fully autonomously, a difficult feat because the sensors and other equipment needed for even partly autonomous driving are expensive. And even as he touted the company's ambitious future plans, he admitted that the company's fully-autonomous driving software experienced unforeseen challenges, prompting a "fundamental rewrite" of the "entire software stack," though he did not detail when that rewrite occurred.<br>
								In years past, Musk had gone so far as to predict that Teslas equipped with the company's "Full Self Driving" hardware would be capable of a "coast-to-coast" autonomous trip by the end of 2017. His self-imposed deadlines have repeatedly been pushed back, however.<br>

								Musk also announced that Tesla is taking orders now for the new three-motor Tesla Model S with "Plaid Mode," a version capable of producing 1,100 horsepower. This car will be able to go from zero to 60 miles an hour in under two seconds and run a quarter-mile drag strip in under nine seconds. Costing about $140,000, the Model S Plaid will have a top speed of 200 miles an hour and will be able to go 520 miles on a full charge, according to Tesla.<br>
								By comparison, the Dodge Challenger SRT Demon, a specialized drag strip car, was capable of going from zero to 60 in 2.3 seconds and running a quarter-mile in 9.65 seconds, according to Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Customers can order the Model S Plaid now, Musk said, and the first ones will be delivered by the end of next year.
								The name "Plaid Mode," like that of the the slightly slower "Ludicrous Mode" available in today's Model S, is taken from the movie Spaceballs, a 1987 parody of Star Wars directed by Mel Brooks. In Star Wars, when spaceships entered "hyperspace" and were traveling faster than the speed of light, the movie screen filled with streaks of smeared starlight. In Spaceballs, a spaceship could go so fast that the streaks of lights became plaid.<br>

								During the lengthy presentation, Musk and Andrew Baglino, Tesla's head of powertrain development, detailed improvements the company has made in its battery design and battery manufacturing capabilities. These advancements could lead to massive reductions in battery costs per kilowatt hour, a measure of a battery's energy-holding capabilities, they said.<br>
								With improved battery cell designs and simplified manufacturing processes, Tesla hopes to attain "terawatt hour scale" manufacturing of batteries. One terawatt hour is 1,000 gigawatt hours or a trillion watt hours. Tesla achieved annualized production of 20 gigawatt hours at its Nevada battery factory in 2018, according to the company's website. At that rate, it was already the highest volume battery production factory in the world, Tesla claims. By 2022, Tesla aims to be producing 100 gigawatt hours annually and, by 2030, 3 terawatt hours.<br>
								Musk and Baglino also predicted that, in the future, Tesla batteries would be fully recyclable so that mining lithium would no longer be needed.
								Musk spent a large part of the evening talking about manufacturing, a topic he frequently discusses at length.<br>

								"Tesla is aiming to be the best at manufacturing of any company on Earth," he said.
								Ultimately, Tesla hopes to make 20 million vehicles a year, Musk said, a figure greater than all passenger vehicles sold in the United States last year. By comparison, Volkswagen Group (VLKPF), which sells Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche and other brands, sold 11 million vehicles worldwide in 2019.<br>
								Despite Musk's concentration on the subject, Tesla has struggled with manufacturing cars at high volume and with good quality. The company scored very poorly in the most recent J.D. Power Initial Quality survey, and the company's initial struggle to assemble its entry-level Model 3 eventually led to cars being assembled in a tent outside the company's Fremont, California factory.<br>
								Musk also outlined a new engineering structure for future Tesla cars in which the front and rear framework of the car would each be made of a single cast piece of aluminum alloy. These would be joined to the battery pack which would, itself, actually form a major part of the car's structure.<br>
								"Its the way all electric cars in the future will ultimately be made," Musk predicted.<br>

							<h3 class="topic">Tesla CEO Elon Musk boasts 500 miles on a single charge at Battery Day event</h3>
							<p class="realContent">
								Tesla is working on new battery technology that CEO Elon Musk says will enable the company to make sleeker, more affordable cars that can travel much longer distances on a single charge.<br>

								But the battery breakthroughs unveiled Tuesday at a highly anticipated event seemed to disappoint Wall Street, with the entrepreneur saying it will take years to develop the enhanced batteries. Investors were hoping Tesla's technology would mark an even bigger leap forward and propel the company's soaring stock to greater heights.<br> 

								Tesla's shares shed more than 6% in extended trading after Musk's presentation, with the stock down another 8% on Wednesday. That deepened a slump that began during Tuesday's regular trading session as investors began to brace for a potential letdown. Musk raised those worries with a series of tweets Monday warning that Tesla's new battery tech might not be ready for high-volume production until 2022.<br>

								"The stock is down on knee-jerk reaction as the biggest disappointment of the event from the Street's perspective was around no million-mile battery announcement in our opinion as this was widely expected to be unveiled," Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a research note.<br> 

								But Ives remain bullish on Tesla's future, citing the company's to make its vehicles more affordable. The company's shares remain on a tear this year, up more than 366%.<br>

								<i>Musk reiterated that timetable during Tuesday's showcase and said it might take up to three years before the battery technology translates into a new Tesla model selling for $25,000. That would be a dramatic markdown from Tesla's cheapest car now, the Model 3, a sedan that starts at $35,000 but usually ends up costing buyers more than $40,000.</i><br>

								"We don't have a truly affordable car, and that is something we want in the future," Musk said during the event.<br>
							</p>	

								<h4 class="subtopic">New battery design</h4>
							<p class="realContent">
								Tesla unveiled its proprietary cell named 4680 — named after its cylindrical measurements of 46 millimeters by 80 millimeters — which offers 6 times the power of its previous cells, 16 times more range, and 5 times the energy capacity, according to Ives in his research note, who believes the new cell to be "a linchpin to [Tesla's] future EV vision with significantly reduced costs and much longer ranges." <br>

								<i>Tesla estimates that a 14% reduction in cost per kilowatt-hour can be achieved with the new "biscuit-tin" battery cell design and a further 18% from its new smaller, more efficient Terafactory manufacturing design.</i><br> 

								The new battery will also be cobalt-free as reported by The Verge. Costly and rare, the mineral cobalt is used in virtually all batteries in common devices, including cellphones, laptops and even electric vehicles. A lawsuit file last year accused some of the biggest technology firms in the United States of complicity in the death and maiming of hundreds, if not thousands of African children who mine cobalt. Tesla was one of the defendants named in the suit, along with Apple, Google parent company Alphabet, Microsoft and Dell.<br>

								Besides lowering the price, Musk promised the new battery technology would help Tesla reduce the size of its vehicles by about 10% and extend their range by 56%. That projection implies the Tesla cars using the new batteries will be able to travel 500 miles (800 kilometers) or more on a single charge, surpassing the distance many gas-combustion cars can traverse before needing to refuel.<br>
							</p>
								
							<h4 class="subtopic">Shareholders in cars </h4>
							<p class="realContent">
								Musk took the stage before a mostly online audience, although there was a small group of shareholders who won a lottery for the right to sit in Tesla vehicles parked in a lot near the company's Fremont, California, factory located about 40 miles (64 kilometers) southeast of San Francisco.<br>

								"It is a little hard to read the room with everyone in cars," Musk joked as he began his presentation during an early phase of the event that was devoted to Tesla's annual meeting of shareholders.<br>

								But the shareholders in attendance frequently beeped their horns to provide a different form of applause as Musk rattled off Tesla's accomplishments since the company held its last annual meeting 15 months ago.<br>

								Since then, Tesla has posted four consecutive quarters of profits to reverse a long history of losses, while boosting its production and laying the groundwork for future expansion by opening or beginning work on three more factories in Shanghai, Berlin and Austin, Texas. All that progress has caused Tesla's stock price to soar by fivefold so far this year and boost the company's market value to nearly $400 billion.<br>

								No one has benefited more from the run-up than Musk, who has seen his estimated wealth climbed to $89 billion — the fifth-largest fortune in the world, based on estimates by Forbes magazine.<br>

								"What happens when companies get bigger is things tend to slow down. We are going to speed up," Musk said Tuesday.<br>

								
							</p>
							<h4 class="subtopic">One step ahead</h4>
							<p class="realContent">
								He said he believes Tesla will remain a step ahead of its competition in the electric vehicle market and persuade more consumers to abandon gas-combustion cars with its new battery technology. The breakthroughs that he outlined Tuesday involve some highly technical changes to the composition and design of batteries, along with new manufacturing processes.<br>

								Even as Tesla tries to set new standards in batteries, Musk made it clear that the company will also continue to rely on Panasonic and other suppliers.<br>

								Musk has a history of being too ambitious in his promises. For instance, 17 months ago, he bragged that Tesla was on the verge of breakthroughs in autonomous driving technology that would enable the company to deploy a fleet of robotic taxis by the end of this year.<br>

								He has since backpedaled slightly from that goal, although Tuesday he said he believes Tesla's $25,000 car will be capable of driving on its own.<br>
